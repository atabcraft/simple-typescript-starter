Typescript Express Node.js, leatest sequilize, postgresql starter. 

This project is a great starter for development using Typescript Express server.

It supports seperate environments for testing. Integration testing with Jest/Supertest

Implemented authentification with JWT token with sample tests for liking and unliking a user. Using feature based folder structure. 

For good development experiance run npm run start:dev, hot reload using nodemon will apply the changes while coding. For IT just name the test file *.test.ts and the Jest will do the rest.
